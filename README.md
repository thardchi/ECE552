# ECE552 – Computer Architecture Projects

This repository contains our work for lab assignments in ECE552: Computer Architecture at the University of Toronto.
Each lab focuses on a different key component of modern CPU microarchitecture: pipelines, branch predictors, dynamic scheduling, prefethcing, and cache coherence controllers.

## 🧩 Projects Included

1. Pipeline Performance & RAW Hazard Analysis
2. Dynamic Branch Prediction
3. Tomasulo Dynamic Scheduling
4. Data Cache Pre-fetchers 
5. MSI Directory-Based Cache Coherence

Completed by: Thardchi Ganesalingam and [Zaid Husseini](https://github.com/husseinizaid).
